## Overview

The goal of the project is to learn 
1. 3-hop architecture to progressively transform data
2. Testing with Great Expectation
3. Implement Factory Pattern

Basically, it pulls order data from S3 bucket. Data is fake by a Docker container which generate data to push to Minio. Data is landed and transform through 3 layers by Spark.
